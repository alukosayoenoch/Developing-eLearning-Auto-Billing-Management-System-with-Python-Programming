# Developing-eLearning-Auto-Billing-Management-System-with-Python-Programming
As the technology is developing and seeing new inventions in various fields including machine learning, artificial intelligence, internet of things (IOT) and so on, there is an increase in the expectations in the consumer point of view. With the fast moving lives, the consumers absolutely have no time to stand in long queues in order to get their work done.  In this video, we can learn how to develop an Auto Billing Manager using, Tkinter; a standard GUI Library for Python. The App has also got automated teller system so as to automatically bill the products put into them and the final bill is sent to a printer for printout.  Automation, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and other technologies, has opened up new possibilities. The pace of adoption has been rapid. Institutions of all sizes globally are leveraging automation to drive value. Based on Statistics and Research, 57% of 1,300 institutions have already started on this journey, with another 18% planning to kick off something within the next phase. When it comes to **AI programming languages**, Python leads the pack with its unparalleled community support and pre-built libraries (like Tkinter, NumPy, Pandas, Pybrain, and SciPy) that help expedite AI development *Artificial Intelligence* is a way of making a computer, **a computer-controlled robot**, or a software think intelligently, in the similar manner the intelligent humans think. The programming language is used globally to design and build 2D imaging software like Inkscape, GIMP, Paint Shop Pro, and Scribus. Also, Python is used in several 3D animation packages such as Blender, Houdini, 3ds Max, Maya, Cinema 4D, and Lightwave, to name a few. • Web Development. Python can be used to make web-applications at a rapid rate • Game Development. Python is also used in the development of interactive games • Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence • Data Science and Data Visualization • Desktop GUI • Web Scraping Applications • Business Applications • CAD Applications  To access more Maths, ICT and videos on Robotic and Coding:  For Free Resources, videos, Board Works and code blocks https://www.amazon.com/Sayo-Enoch-Aluko/e/B092ZZD72B%3Fref  https://www.tes.com/teaching-resources/shop/alukosayoenoch https://www.youtube.com/c/SayoEnochAluko/videos
